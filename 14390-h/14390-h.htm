    <p>"What's in an 'at without an 'ed?" DISTAFFINA DE COCKAIGNE
    was wont to inquire, and "what's an 'all" (of Music like the
    London Pavilion) "without a NED" in the shape of Mr. EDWARD
    SWANBOROUGH, the all-knowing yet ever-green Acting Manager at
    this place of entertainment, who possessing the secret of
    perpetual youth in all the glory of ever-resplendent hat and
    ever-dazzling shirt-front, ushers us into the Stalls in time to
    hear the best part of an excellent all-round show. It is sad to
    think that, probably as we were disputing with the cabman, the
    celebrated Miss BOOM-TE-RÉ-SA, alias LOTTIE COLLINS,
    Serio-Comic and Dancer, was "booming" and "teraying" before the
    eyes of a delighted audience. Strange that we should not yet
    have heard the great original. But as she is not (so to adapt a
    line from the "<i>Last Rose of Summer</i>") "left booming
    alone," we have not escaped hearing several of her male and
    female imitators who, by her kind permission and that of her
    publishers, trade on her present exceptional success. However,
    when we entered the Stalls, Miss BOOM-TE-RÉ-SA had disappeared,
    and somebody with a song had "intervened"&mdash;a mode of
    proceeding not necessarily limited to the Queen's
    Proctor&mdash;before the object of our visit walked on to the
    stage, and when he did come a pretty object he was too, seeing
    that it was Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER, the unequalled and inimitable
    Comedian of the Costermongers. He is a thorough artist in this
    particular line, and no indifferent one in others; but his
    Coster ballads are artistically first rate. The fashion of
    calling English singers by Italian names is on the wane,
    otherwise Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER, of French extraction, would
    find an excellent Italian alias, closely associated with the
    operatic and musical professions, and most appropriate to the
    line he has adopted, in the name of "SIGNOR COSTA." The melody
    of Mr. CHEVALIER's "<i>Coster's Serenade</i>," of which, I
    rather think, he is the composer as well as librettist, is as
    charming as it is strikingly original. After the <i>Chevalier
    sans peur et sans approche</i> had retired, clever and
    sprightly Miss JENNY HILL gave as a taste of
    lodging-house-keeperism, following whom came the Two MACS
    belabouring each other in their old hopelessly idiotic, but
    always utterly irresistible style; and then Lieutenant W.
    COLE&mdash;King COLE we "crowned him long ago"&mdash;gave his
    ventriloquial entertainment, who, with his troop of talking
    dolls, should have his address at Dollis Hill. There were many
    "turns" yet to follow when we left, at a comparatively early
    hour; "and so," to quote old PEPYS, "home with much
    content."</p>

    <h2>HOW TO REPORT THE PRACTICE OF THE CREWS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Newest Style.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Scarcely had the tintinabulum fixed on the altitude of the
    clock tower of the ecclesiastical building known to fame and
    rowing men as Putney Church sounded out the merry chimes of
    eleven in the forenoon, when the wielders of the sky-blue (or
    dark-blue) blades were observed by the eager frequenters of the
    tow-path carrying their trim-built ship to the water's edge.
    Not many moments were cut to waste before each man had safely
    ensconced himself on the thwart built for him under the
    experienced eyes of the champion boat-builder. The men looked,
    it must in all fairness be admitted, in the high level of
    condition. In each eye there blazed a stern determination to do
    or die on every possible occasion. When the signal to start was
    given, the boat was observed to move with the bounding speed of
    a highly-trained greyhound. The oars dipped into the water like
    one man, though a marked inclination was observed on the part
    of two or three of the oarsmen to "hurry," while the rest
    seemed equally disposed to be "late." A few fatherly words from
    the prince of modern coaches soon had the desired effect of
    placing matters on a more completely satisfactory footing. The
    suggestion often made in these columns that a swifter rate of
    striking should be introduced, was acted upon. The boat moved
    with perfect evenness, while the wavelets played round her like
    young dolphins out for a holiday.</p>

    <p>I need only add that our old friend Jupiter Pluvius proved
    once again to be a kind friend to those who tempted the dangers
    of the foaming tide in Putney Reach. In conclusion, it must be
    observed that the stroke was sometimes "short" and occasionally
    "long," but the "slides" moved like things of life, and
    contributed greatly to the pleasure of a very enjoyable
    outing.</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>VII.&mdash;THE DUFFER WITH A SALMON-ROD.</h3>

    <p>No pursuit is more sedentary, if one may talk of a sedentary
    pursuit, and none more to my taste, than trout-fishing as
    practised in the South of England. Given fine weather, and a
    good novel, nothing can he more soothing than to sit on a
    convenient stump, under a willow, and watch the placid kine
    standing in the water, while the brook murmurs on, and perhaps
    the kingfisher flits to and fro. Here you sit and fleet the
    time carelessly, till a trout rises. Then, indeed, duty demands
    that you shall crawl in the manner of the serpent till you come
    within reach of him, and cast a fly, which usually makes him
    postpone his dinner-hour. But he will come on again, there is
    no need for you to change your position, and you can always
    fill your basket easily&mdash;with irises and
    marsh-marigolds.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/160.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/160.png"
             alt="'I wade in as far as I can, and make a tremendous swipe with the rod.'" />
        </a>"I wade in as far as I can, and make a tremendous swipe
        with the rod."
    </div>

    <p>Such are our county contents, but woe befall the day when I
    took to salmon-fishing. The outfit is expensive, "half-crown
    flees" soon mount up, especially if you never go out without
    losing your fly-book. If you buy a light rod, say of fourteen
    feet, the chances are that it will not cover the water, and a
    longer rod requires in the fisherman the strength of a SANDOW.
    You need wading-breeches, which come up nearly to the neck, and
    weigh a couple of stone. The question has been raised, can one
    swim in them, in case of an accident? For <i>one</i>, I can
    answer, he can't. The reel is about the size of a butter-keg,
    the line measures hundreds of yards, and the place where you
    fish for salmon is usually at the utter ends of the earth. Some
    enthusiasts begin in February. Covered with furs, they sit in
    the stern of a boat, and are pulled in a funereal manner up and
    down Loch Tay, while the rods fish for themselves. The angler's
    only business is to pick them up if a salmon bites, and when
    this has gone on for a few days, with no bite, Influenza, or a
    hard frost with curling, would be rather a relief. This kind of
    thing is not really angling, and a Duffer is as good at it as
    an expert.</p>

    <p>Real difficulties and sufferings begin when you reach the
    Cruach-na-spiel-bo, which sounds like Gaelic, and will serve us
    as a name for the river. It is, of course, extremely probable
    that you pay a large rent for the right to gaze at a series of
    red and raging floods, or at a pale and attenuated trickle of
    water, murmuring peevishly through a drought. But suppose, for
    the sake of argument, that the water is "in order," and only
    running with deep brown swirls at some thirty miles an hour.
    Suppose also, a large presumption, that the Duffer does not
    leave any indispensable part of his equipment at home. He
    arrives at the stream, and as he detests a gillie, whose
    contempt for the Duffer breeds familiarity, he puts up his rod,
    selects a casting line, knots on the kind of fly which is
    locally recommended, and steps into the water. Oh, how cold it
    is! I begin casting at the top of the stream, and step from a
    big boulder into a hole. Stagger, stumble, violent bob
    forwards, recovery, trip up, and here one is in a sitting
    position in the bed of the stream. However, the high
    india-rubber breeks have kept the water out, except about a
    pailful, which gradually illustrates the equilibrium of fluids
    in the soles of one's stockings. However, I am on my feet
    again, and walking more gingerly, though to the spectator, my
    movements suggest partial intoxication. That is because the bed
    of the stream is full of boulders, which one cannot see, owing
    to the darkness of the water. There was a fish rose near the
    opposite side. My heart is in my mouth. I wade in as far as I
    can, and make a tremendous swipe with the rod. A frantic tug
    behind, crash, there goes the top of the rod! I am caught up in
    the root of a pine-tree, high up on the bank at my back. No use
    in the language of imprecation. I waddle out, climb the bank,
    extricate the fly, get out a spare top, and to work again, more
    cautiously. Something wrong, the hook has caught in my coat,
    between my shoulders. I must get the coat off somehow, not an
    easy thing to do, on account of my india-rubber armour. It is
    off at last. I cut the hook out with a knife making a big hole
    in the coat, and cast again. That was over him! I let the fly
    float down, working it scientifically. No response. Perhaps
    better look at the fly. Just my luck, I have cracked it
    off!</p>

    <p>Where is the fly-book? Where indeed? A feverish search for
    the fly-book follows&mdash;no use: it is not in the basket, it
    is not in my pocket; must have fallen out when I fell into the
    river. No good in looking for it, the water is too thick, I
    <i>thought</i> I heard a splash. Luckily there are some flies
    in my cap, it looks knowing to have some flies in one's cap,
    and it is not so easy to lose a cap, without noticing it, as to
    lose most things. Here is a big Silver Doctor that may do as
    the water is thick. I put one on, and begin again casting over
    where that fish rose. By George, there he came at me, at least
    I think it must have been at me, a great dark swirl, "the
    purple wave bowed over it like a hill," but he never touched
    me. Give him five minutes law, the hook is sure to be well
    fastened on, need not bother looking at that again. Five
    minutes take a long time in passing, when you are giving a
    salmon a rest. Good times and bad times and all times pass, so
    here goes. It is correct to begin a good way above him and come
    down to him. I'm past him; no, there is a long heavy drag under
    water, I get the point up, he is off like a shot, while I stand
    in a rather stupid attitude, holding on. If I cannot get out
    and run down the bank, he has me at his mercy. I do stagger
    out, somehow, falling on my back, but keeping the point up with
    my right hand. No bones broken, but surely he is gone! I begin
    reeling up the line, with a heavy heart, and try to lift it out
    of the water. It won't come, he is here still, he has only
    doubled back. Hooray! Nothing so nice as being all alone when
    you hook a salmon. No gillie to scream out contradictory
    orders. He is taking it very easy, but suddenly he moves out a
    few yards, and begins jiggering, that is, giving a series of
    short heavy tugs. They say he is never well hooked, when he
    jiggers. The rod thrills unpleasantly in my hands, I wish he
    wouldn't do that. It is very disagreeable and makes me very
    nervous. Hullo! he is off again up-stream, the reel ringing
    like mad: he gets into the thin water at the top, and jumps
    high in the air. He is a monster. Hullo! what's that splash?
    The reel has fallen off, it was always loose, and has got into
    the water. How am I to act now? He is coming back like mad, and
    all the line is loose, and I can't reel up. I begin pulling at
    the line to bring up the reel, but the reel only lets the line
    out, and now he is off again, down stream this time, and I
    after him, and the line running out at both ends at once, and
    now my legs get entangled in it, it is twisted all round me. He
    runs again and jumps, the line comes back in my face, all
    slack, something has given. It is the hook, it was not knotted
    on firmly to start with. He flings himself out of the water
    once more to be sure that he is free, and I sit down and gnaw
    the reel. Had ever anybody such bad fortune, but it is just my
    luck!</p>

    <p>I go back to the place where the reel fell in, and by
    pulling cautiously I extract it from the stream. It shan't come
    off again; I tie it on with the leather lace of one of my
    brogues. Then I reel up the slack, and put on another fly, out
    of my cap, a Popham. Then I fish down the rest of the pool.
    Near the edge, in the slower part of the water, there is a long
    slow draw, before I can lift the point of the rod, a salmon
    jumps high out of the water at me,&mdash;and is gone! I never
    struck him, was too much taken aback at the moment; did not
    expect him then. Thank goodness, the hook is not off this
    time.</p>

    <p>The next stream is very deep, strong and narrow; the best
    chance is close in on my side. By Jove, here he is, he took
    almost beside the rock. He sails leisurely out into the
    strength of the stream, if he will come up, I can manage him,
    but if he goes down, the water is very swift and broken, there
    are big boulders, and then a sheer wall of rock difficult to
    pass in cold blood, and then the Big Pool.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> He insists on going down, I
       hold hard on him, and refuse line. But he leaps, and then,
       well he <i>will</i> have it; down he rushes, I after him,
       over the stones, scrambling along the rocky face; great
       heavens! <i>the top joint of the rod is loose</i>; I did not
       tie it on, thought it would hold well enough. But down it
       runs, right down the line; it must be touching the fish. It
       is; he does not like it, he jiggers like a mad thing, rushes
       across the Big Pool, nearly on to the opposite bank. Why
       won't the line run? The line is entangled in my boot-lace.
       He is careering about; I feel that I am trembling like a
       leaf. There, I knew it would happen; he is off with my last
       casting-line, hook and all. A beauty he was, clear as silver
       and fresh from the sea. Well, there is nothing for it but a
       walk back to the house. I have lost one fly-book, two hooks,
       a couple of casting-lines, three salmon, a top joint, and I
       have torn a great hole in my coat. On changing my dress
       before lunch, I find my fly-book in my breast pocket, where
       I had not thought of looking for it somehow. Then the rain
       comes, and there is not another fishing day in my fortnight.
       Still, it decidedly was "one crowded hour of glorious life,"
       while it lasted. The other men caught four or five salmon
       apiece; it is their Red Letter Day. It is marked in black in
       my calendar.</p>

    <p>I am an impecunious young man, and, the other day, on seeing
    this Advertisement in the <i>Times</i>, I was seized with a
    wild desire to "at once secure above reward." Said I to myself,
    "I have 'wealthy and influential friends.' There is my cousin's
    uncle, who has, I believe, thirty thousand a-year, though I
    never saw any part of it, or of him, for the matter of that;
    and there is my own aunt by marriage, whose second husband is a
    K.C.B., but I forget his name, and do not know where he lives."
    So I sat and thought about it for a time with my eyes shut, and
    then I started. The train was so full, that I imagined it must
    be market-day in some neighbouring town, but the station was so
    much fuller, that I could hardly get out of the train. At last,
    edgeways, I reached a pale and melancholy ticket-collector, and
    asked him where I should find the address mentioned. He turned
    a pitying eye upon me, and, pointing to the crowd that filled
    the station, said, wearily, "They're all a-goin' there. I know,
    cos they've all arst me. You'd better foller 'em."</p>

    <p>This statement filled me with desperation; I fought and
    struggled through the vast crowd of persons "with wealthy and
    influential friends" until I reached the open street. By that
    time I was exhausted, and, finding that the street was even
    fuller than the station had been, I gave up the attempt. I saw
    that the reserve of gold at the Bank of England would not have
    sufficed to pay each applicant the promised £50. In any case I
    felt sure that by that time the whole of the money in the town
    must have been used up. So, without hat or umbrella, and with
    my coat as much divided up the back as up the front, I
    returned&mdash;to consciousness, and went on reading the
    newspaper.</p>

        one another long and irrelevant stories, all about nothing.

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 21.</i>&mdash;Uneasy
    feeling spread through House to-night consequent on question
    addressed by MACINNES to UNDER-SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
    Wants to know "whether his attention has been called to the
    increase of drinking among Natives in the Coast Towns?" CAUSTON
    particularly depressed.</p>

             </a>"&mdash;an Agricultural Labourer."
    </div>

    <p>"I sat for Colchester for five years, you know," he said,
    "and grew into habit of regarding the Natives as my
    constituents. For five years never swallowed one without
    thinking I was reducing the number on the Register. Used to
    excuse myself on the ground that the particular bivalve that
    had disappeared must have been a Conservative, or it would
    never have been so stupid as to leave its comfortable bed to
    embark on such a journey. My interest in the oyster is now
    secondary. They don't flourish in Southwark; whelks more in our
    way down there. Still one cannot forget old associations, and
    confess I'm rather knocked over to hear this report MACINNES
    has brought up. Can't imagine anything more distressing than
    the spectacle of a drunken oyster&mdash;probably with
    dishevelled beard&mdash;coming home late at night and trying to
    get into another Native's shell under impression that he has
    recognised his own front door. Must see WILFRID LAWSON about
    this; get up an Oyster Temperance Society; framed certificates,
    blue ribbon, and all that, if the thing spreads, we shall have
    oysters emitting quite a rum-punch flavour when we add the
    lemon."</p>

    <p>Gloom dissipated two hours later by appearance of BOBBY
    SPENCER at the Table. BOBBY doesn't often witch the House with
    oratory. Content with important though to outsiders obscure
    position he occupies in Party administration. His is the hand
    that pulls the strings to which Liberal Party dance.
    SCHNADHORST gets some credit, but everybody knows BOBBY's the
    man. To see these two political strategists in conference is
    sufficient to reassure the Liberal Party on the possible issues
    of the General Election.</p>

    <p>SCHNADHORST complains that BOBBY has a trick, after
    addressing him through the ear-trumpet he (S.) carries in
    reminiscence of JOSHUA REYNOLDS, of putting his ear to the
    trumpet as if he expected the answer to arrive through that
    medium.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"Very embarrassing." SCHNADHORST says, "to have a fellow
    first putting his mouth and then his ear to other end of your
    trumpet. Sometimes I say to him, sharply, '<i>I</i> don't speak
    through the trumpet.' 'Oh, no, of course not,' he says, 'I beg
    your pardon,' and draws away. Presently he's back again,
    politely, as I speak, applying his ear to the trumpet. But it's
    only the absence of mind that arises from preoccupation in
    matters of State."</p>

    <p>BOBBY, besides being the political director of the strategy
    of the Liberal Party, is a County Member. It was in this last
    capacity he appeared at Table to-night in Debate on Second
    Reading of Small Holdings Bill. House received him with hearty
    cheer. No one more popular than BOBBY. Delight uproariously
    manifested when, daintily pulling at his abundant shirt-cuff,
    and settling his fair young head more comfortably upon summit
    of his monumental collar, he deprecatingly observed&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. SPEAKER, Sir, I am not an Agricultural Labourer."</p>

    <p>The speech a model of Parliamentary debating, full of point,
    resting on sound argument, lucidly stated, and all over in five
    minutes. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Small Holdings
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Morning Sitting. SEXTON at length
    worked off the speech on Irish Education Bill, that has hung
    over House like cloud since Bill was introduced in earliest
    days of Session. Wasn't in his place the first night; so
    friends and colleagues wore out the sitting to preserve his
    opportunity. When this next presented itself, SEXTON thought
    the hour and condition of House unsuitable for person of his
    consequence; declined to speak. To-day, his last chance, things
    worse than ever. Benches empty, as usual at Morning Sitting.
    But now or never, and at least there would be long report in
    Irish papers. So went at it by the hour. Finished at a quarter
    to five. At Morning Sitting, debate automatically suspended at
    ten minutes to seven; two hours and five minutes for everyone
    else to speak. SINCLAIR long waiting chance to thrust in his
    nose. Found it at last; but House wearied and worn out; glad
    when seven o'clock approached, and Bill read First

    <p>At Evening Sitting, Lawyers had it all to themselves.
    ROBERTSON opened Debate on Law of Conspiracy in admirable
    speech. Later came LOCKWOOD, speaking disrespectfully of "B."
    Then SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, girding at SOLICITOR-GENERAL; MATTHEWS
    followed, with plump assertion that Squire had not been talking
    about the Resolution. Finally CHARLES RUSSELL, with
    demonstration that "the Right Hon. Gentleman (meaning MATTHEWS)
    had displayed a complete misconception of the character and
    objects of the Resolution." Being thus demonstrated upon
    unimpeachable authority that nobody knew anything about the
    Resolution, House proceeded to vote upon it. For, 180; against,
    226. Ministerialists cheered; Opposition apparently equally
    delighted. So home I to bed, everyone determined first thing in
    morning get hold of newspaper, and see what the Resolution
    really was about. <i>Business

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;"I wonder," said SAGE OF QUEEN
    ANNE'S GATE, curiously regarding CHAMBERLAIN discoursing on the
    Eight Hours Bill, "whom JOE meant by his reference at
    Birmingham on Saturday night to 'the funny man of the House of
    Commons,'&mdash;'A man who has a natural taste for buffoonery,
    which he has cultivated with great art, who has a hatred of
    every Government and all kinds of restraint, and especially, of
    course, of the Government that happens to be in office.'
    Couldn't be HENEAGE, and I don't suppose he had JESSE in his
    mind at the moment. Pity a man can't make his points clearly.
    JOE used to be lucid enough. But he's falling off now in that
    as in other matters. Made me rub my eyes when I read his
    remarks about House of Lords, and remembered what he used to
    say on subject when he and I ran together. Certainly JOE is a
    man of courage. There are topics he might, with memory of past
    speeches, easily avoid or circumnavigate. But he goes straight
    at 'em, whether fence or ditch, takes them at a stride
    regardless of his former self, splashed with mud in the jump,
    or smitten with the horse's hoof. Makes me quite sentimental
    when I sit and listen to him, and recall days that are no more.

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Eight Hours' Bill thrown out on
    a Division.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Private O'GRADY, of the Welsh
    Fusiliers, the hero of the hour. His annals short and simple.
    Got up early in the morning of St. Patrick's Day; provided
    himself with handful of shamrock, which he stuck in his
    glengarry. (<i>Note</i>.&mdash;O'GRADY, an Irishman, belongs to
    a Welsh Regiment, and, to complete the pickle, wears a Scotch
    cap.) The ignorant Saxon officer in command observing the
    patriot muster with what he, all unconscious of St. Patrick's
    Day, thought was "a handful of greens" in his cap, instructed
    the non-commissioned officer to order him to take it out.</p>

    <p>"I won't do't," said gallant Private O'GRADY, the hot Celtic
    blood swiftly brought to boiling pitch by this insult to St.
    Patrick. Irish Members vociferously cheered when STANHOPE read
    the passage from Colonel's report. Another non-commissioned
    officer advancing from the rear, repeated order.</p>

    <p>"I won't do't!" roared the implacable Private O'GRADY.</p>

    <p>Once more the Irish Members burst into cheering, whilst a
    soldier in uniform in Strangers' Gallery looked on and
    listened. Would like to hear his account of scene confided to
    comrades in privacy of barrack-room.</p>

    <p>When STANHOPE finished reading report of officer commanding
    battalion, Irish Members leaped to their feet in body, each
    anxious to stand shoulder to shoulder with Private O'GRADY
    defying the Saxon. NOLAN, who had set ball rolling, might have
    got in first, but was so excited as to be momentarily
    speechless; could only paw at the air in direction of Treasury
    Bench where STANHOPE sat, PAT O'BRIEN, ARTHUR O'CONNOR, the
    wily WEBB, and the flaccid FLYNN, all shouting together. But
    SEXTON beat them all, and will duly figure in Parliamentary
    Report as Vindicator of Nationality, Defender of St. Patrick,
    and Patron of Private O'GRADY.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing new about Ireland," said POLTALLOCH,
    talking the matter over later in the Lobby. "'Tis the most
    distressful country that ever yet was seen, Where they punish
    T. O'GRADY For the wearing of the Green."</p>

    House arbiter of situation; might have voted itself anything a
    year it pleased. Only say the word, and JOKIM would have been
    bound to find the money. Members flocked down in large numbers:
    CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, seated on Front Opposition Bench, declares
    he could distinctly hear smacking of lips of Hon. Members below
    Gangway when FENWICK observed he thought £365 a year would be
    reasonable allowance. However insidious temptation may have
    been, it was nobly resisted. Of nearly 400 Members who took
    part in Division, only 162 reached out their hand for the
    pittance, 227 lofty souls going into other Lobby.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
